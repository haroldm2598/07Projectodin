					CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
					physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at

				</p>
				<p class="main__content--para2">
					He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
					particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he

					force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
					for a prodigiously violent instant.

					If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the

					beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

					Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
					time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
					John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
					detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
					waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
					when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
					second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
					inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
					correct.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p3">
					Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
					many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p4">
					If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
					comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
					apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
					and space and energy to science and speculation.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p5">
					Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
					billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
					galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
					extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
					universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
					into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

					accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
					Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational

					should ruffle space-time.

				<p class="main__content--p31">
					In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave

				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p32">
					This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the

					direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
					direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a
					result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows
					going in spirals.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p33">
					Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
					differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
					telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

					Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
					electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have
					long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a
					single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
					moments.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p38">
					As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
					from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling
					out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after
					another splitting away.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p39">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
				<p class="main__content--p40">
					Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
					temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which
					point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p41">
					Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state
					too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a
					mysterious latent energy.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p42">
					Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a
					kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it
					was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
					created, the harder it pushed apart.
				</p>

					What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least
					a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial
					energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p44">
					Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
					particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
					resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
					billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such
					thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might

					Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting

					is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
					homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
					spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
					multiverse.
				</p>
				<p class="main__content--p46">
